feat: Implement MudServer class and integrate into main app

- Refactor server logic into a `MudServer` class in `server.py`.
  - The class manages the aiohttp application lifecycle (`start`, `stop`).
  - It handles WebSocket connections, including authentication and basic command processing.
  - Integrates `PlayerManager` for handling player-related logic.

- Update `main.py` to use the `MudServer`.
  - The main function now initializes the database, managers, and the server.
  - Implements graceful startup and shutdown sequences.
  - Removes old test code, making `main.py` the clean entry point for the server.
